### Project Components
1. Genome assembly using long and short read sequencing with HiC chromatin capture
2. Genome annotation
3. Transcriptome assembly using RNA-seq from five tissues
4. Pool-seq of 15 snow crab populations across Atlantic Canada to examine population structure
5. Environmental association analysis

# Component 4: PoolSeq
